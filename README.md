# SentimentAnalysis


A Deep Learning model designed to classify sentiments in movie reviews as either positive or negative. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and neural networks to perform sentiment analysis on text data.



## Project Overview
This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model using deep learning to determine the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled reviews with sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Features
-**Tokenizer & Padding**: Preprocesses text data by tokenizing words and padding sequences to ensure consistent input length.

-**Deep Learning Model**: LSTM network with dropout layers to handle sequential text data.

-**Binary Sentiment Classification**: Encodes text data for binary classification, predicting positive or negative sentiment.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, the following packages are required:

-tensorflow

-pandas

-scikit-learn

## Project Structure
-**sentiment_analyzer.py**: Contains the main code for the sentiment analysis model.

-**README.md**: Project documentation.

-**data.csv**: Sample training data file (placeholder for actual data)

## Data Requirements
The model expects a CSV file (data.csv) with two columns:

-text: The text or reviews for analysis.

-label: Binary sentiment labels (e.g., 0 for negative, 1 for positive).

## Model Details
The model architecture includes:

-**Embedding Layer**: Word embedding for vectorizing input text.

-**Spatial Dropout Layer**: Reduces overfitting by randomly dropping units.

-**LSTM Layer**: Processes sequential data to capture context.

-**Dense Output Layer**: Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification.

## Example
Review: "The movie was fantastic!" | Predicted Sentiment: Positive

Review: "It was the worst film I've ever seen." | Predicted Sentiment: Negative

These examples showcase the model’s effectiveness in correctly identifying sentiment based on context and word associations.

## Conclusion
The LSTM-based model demonstrated strong performance on the binary sentiment classification task, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. The LSTM’s sequential processing capability proved valuable in capturing dependencies within text, helping it understand nuanced expressions of sentiment. However, the model’s performance could be further improved by exploring more advanced architectures and refining hyperparameters. This study contributes to the field of sentiment analysis by providing insights into the use of LSTM networks for text-based tasks, offering a strong foundation for more complex NLP applications.

## Future Work
-**Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conduct systematic experiments to find the optimal learning rate, batch size, and LSTM layer configuration to maximize accuracy and generalization.

-**Advanced Architectures**: Explore bidirectional LSTMs, which consider context from both directions in a sequence, or Transformer-based models that use attention mechanisms to better capture relationships within text.

-**Dataset Expansion**: Train the model on larger and more diverse datasets, which could improve its ability to generalize across different domains and varied expressions of sentiment.
