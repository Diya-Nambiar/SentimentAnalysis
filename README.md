## Project Overview
This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model using deep learning to determine the sentiment expressed in movie reviews. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled reviews with sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

## Features
- **Binary Sentiment Classification**: Classifies text reviews as positive or negative.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization and embedding layers for processing raw text data.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Allows users to input reviews and get immediate sentiment predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Reports accuracy, loss, and validation metrics during training.
